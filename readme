As part of the Data Scientists Team you are assigned to a new project. 
In the first meeting with your new stakeholder you learn that she wants to sell more Term Deposits as they represent 
a good sources of income for the bank and she has a KPI to meet by the end of the year (on Term Deposits).<br />  
(A Term Deposit is a cash investment with a financial institution. 
The customerâ€™s money are invested for pre-agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time thus encouraging the customer to keep the money with the bank.
The bank has various options of using this money to generate more profit: e.g. lend it.)<br />  
You also learn that currently there is in place a set of business rules that are used to generate leads 
(i.e. customers that should be contacted and proposed a Term Deposit) but the branch colleagues are reluctant to act based on these leads. 
They lack the explanation of why a certain customer 
should be contacted and thus the treatment rate is very low (a very small % of the leads are treated) and 
the feedback for these leads is mostly negative (most of the time they flag the lead as not relevant). 
Also there is no documentation for these business rules and the colleague that deployed them no longer works in the bank.
